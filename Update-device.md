# Update a Device While its Program Runs #

## Before You Begin ##

### About This Lab ###
You'll create another update flow that updates a device while it runs. It's recommended that you get binaries you need working on one device before rolling out updates to the entire fleet. In the field, you may also need to reboot the devices as part of the update. Whenever you specify files as part of an update flow, they are automatically stored on you JFrog platform/Artifactory instance.

### About JFrog Connect ###
JFrog Connect is a modern Linux-first IoT platform designed to efficiently monitor, manage and update edge and IoT devices at scale. This is performed over a network connection, also known as over the air (OTA).
Use-cases include manufacturing, automotive, security cameras, kiosks, and robots.

### Requirments ###
- Have in instance of JFrog Connect.
- Have a Raspberry Pi (RPi) or virtual device registered in Connect.
- Have downloaded and deployed the initial files as part of the previous lab.
